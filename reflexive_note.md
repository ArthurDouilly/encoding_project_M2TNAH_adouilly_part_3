# XML-TEI Encoding project - Reflexive note

During the course of this project and its three assignments, I have learned much about how to use XML and especially TEI.

## Using XML : understanding its logic and ecosystem

I feel like the most important part of my learning process has been understanding the logic which structures XML (how elements are structured, what attributes are, how they are encoded) and its 'ecosystem', that is to say the other file formats and languages that are part of using XML. This I have learned with assignments 1 & 2 (associating and writing a DTD) but also with assignment 3 (customizing a scheme with ODD and RNG, understanding XSLT transformations and XPATH). I feel like these assigments have been key in getting a better understanding of that logic because it gave me a practical example on which I could work and see the changes.

## Learning how to use TEI

This was at the heart of assignments 2 and 3, even though I had tried to use TEI as a base to build my DTD in assignment 1. In truth, I think that this limited me a little bit in understanding how to employ XML by myself. As of assignment 3, I think that I have obtained a solid understanding of the basics of TEI, especially when it comes to understanding its documentation on the TEI Guidelines website.

## Difficulties ? Strategies ?

At times it was quite difficult to understand why something was not validating. This was especially the case in assignment 3 with the transformation from ODD to RNG, where sometimes the ODD file would show no errors but the RNG one would. 

Knowing where to look in the documentation and using the powerpoints and examples from class as reference were key to fixing some of the mistakes which I had made.
