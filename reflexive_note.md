# XML-TEI Encoding project - Reflexive note

## Understanding XML's logic and ecosystem

The most important part of my learning process has been understanding the logic which structures XML (how elements are structured, what attributes are, how they are encoded) and its 'ecosystem' (the other file formats and languages one must understand for advanced XML use). 

This I have learned with assignments 1 & 2 (associating and writing a DTD) but also with assignment 3 (customizing a scheme with ODD and RNG, understanding XSLT transformations and XPATH). I feel like the three assignment structure was especially good for this because it allowed for gradual exploration of these systems outside of the classroom.

## Learning how to use TEI

This process was at the heart of assignments 2 and 3. I had tried to use TEI as a base to build my DTD in assignment 1 but I think that this was a hindrance at the start. As of assignment 3, I think that I have obtained a stronger understanding of the basics of TEI, but also of why it is important to think ahead when using TEI and why customizing it can be key to a better-structured project.

## Difficulties & strategies

At times it was quite difficult to understand why something was not validating. This was especially the case in assignment 3 with the transformation from ODD to RNG, where sometimes the ODD file would show no errors but the RNG one would. Additionally, it was also difficult to tell what the error messages meant at first.

In both cases, knowing where to look in the documentation and using the powerpoints and examples from class as reference were key strategies to fix my mistakes. As such, I would say especially that I learned about the importance of documentation.
