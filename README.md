# TNAH2 - XML-TEI - Assignment #3

This repository contains my submission to the final assignment of the XML-TEI class given as part of the second year TNAH programme at the École nationale des Chartes. The objective was to encode all three original sample files into XML, then verify if they validated against a RNG scheme generated through an ODD file generated from one of the XML files.

## Structure of this repository

Within this repository are found the following files required for the assignment :
